# polygons-hexgrid
Visualizing OSM POIs on polygons and hexagonal grid

## What's that?
This repo consists of a simple notebook ```main.ipynb``` and a script ```create_hexgrid.py```. Together, they will allow you to download, preprocess and visualize OpenStreetMaps Point of Interest data for Greater London. You can also adjust the URLs and use it for any other city in the world. All credits go to @willgeary and @HTenkanen, I just put pieces together. 

## How-to
Clone or download the repo and experiment with ```main.ipynb``` locally on your machine. All required packages are listed in ```environment.yml``` file. Alternatively, you can run it online by clicking on the binder or Google Colab badges (faster option) on top of this README.md.
