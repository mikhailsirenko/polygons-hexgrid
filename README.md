# polygons-hexgrid
Visualizing OSM POIs on polygons and hexagonal grid

## What's that?
This repo consists of a simple notebook ```main.ipynb``` and a script ```create_hexgrid.py```. Together, they will allow you to download, preprocess and visualize OpenStreetMaps Point of Interest data for Greater London. You can also adjust the URLs and use it for any other city in the world. All credits go to @willgeary and @HTenkanen, I've just put pieces together.
